    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Sugar Two cups of white sugar add the perfect amount of sweetness, while
        locking in the moisture from the other ingredients.
      </li>
      <li>
        Flour All-purpose flour provides structure, acts as a thickening agent,
        and helps build the fluffy texture.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cocoa Powder Of course, you'll want to use Hershey's brand unsweetened
        cocoa powder for this one. It adds the rich, indulgent flavor you know
        and love.
      </li>
      <li>
        Leaveners Baking powder and baking soda act as leaveners, which means
        they cause the batter to expand and give the cake a perfect rise.
      </li>
      <li>
        Salt Just a teaspoon of salt is all you'll need to add complexity and
        highlight the other flavors. It might not seem like a lot, but you'll
        definitely miss the salt if you skip it.
      </li>
      <li>
        Eggs Whole eggs affect the cake in a number of ways: They provide
        structure, add moisture, lend flavor, and contribute to a tender
        texture.
      </li>
      <li>
        Milk Whole milk adds moisture and helps the batter come together
        smoothly.
      </li>
      <li>Oil Vegetable oil ensures your cake will never be dry.</li>
      <li>
        Vanilla Two teaspoons of vanilla extract add complex flavor and bring
        out the flavors of the other ingredients, such as the cocoa powder.
      </li>
      <li>
        Boiling Water You might be wondering why this recipe calls for a cup of
        boiling water. It intensifies the chocolatey flavor, contributes to the
        fluffy texture, and reacts with the leaveners to create an even higher
        rise.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>instructions</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Make the Batter Stir together the dry ingredients in a mixing bowl. Add
        the wet ingredients and beat with an electric mixer for about three
        minutes. Stir in the boiling water by hand.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake the Cake Pour the batter into two prepared cake pans. Bake in a
        preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean.
        Let the cakes cool slightly before removing from the pans.
      </li>
      <li>
        Frost the Cake While the cake finishes cooling to room temperature, make
        the frosting: Cream the butter, stir in the cocoa and confectioners'
        sugar alternately with the milk and vanilla, and beat until it's smooth
        and spreadable.
      </li>
    </ol>
